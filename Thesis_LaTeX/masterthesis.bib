@article{Oldham.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Genomic datasets generated by new technologies are increasingly prevalent in disparate areas of biological research. While many studies have sought to characterize relationships among genomic features, commensurate efforts to characterize relationships among biological samples have been less common. Consequently, the full extent of sample variation in genomic studies is often under-appreciated, complicating downstream analytical tasks such as gene co-expression network analysis.

RESULTS

Here we demonstrate the use of network methods for characterizing sample relationships in microarray data generated from human brain tissue. We describe an approach for identifying outlying samples that does not depend on the choice or use of clustering algorithms. We introduce a battery of measures for quantifying the consistency and integrity of sample relationships, which can be compared across disparate studies, technology platforms, and biological systems. Among these measures, we provide evidence that the correlation between the connectivity and the clustering coefficient (two important network concepts) is a sensitive indicator of homogeneity among biological samples. We also show that this measure, which we refer to as cor(K,C), can distinguish biologically meaningful relationships among subgroups of samples. Specifically, we find that cor(K,C) reveals the profound effect of Huntington's disease on samples from the caudate nucleus relative to other brain regions. Furthermore, we find that this effect is concentrated in specific modules of genes that are naturally co-expressed in human caudate nucleus, highlighting a new strategy for exploring the effects of disease on sets of genes.

CONCLUSIONS

These results underscore the importance of systematically exploring sample relationships in large genomic datasets before seeking to analyze genomic feature activity. We introduce a standardized platform for this purpose using freely available R software that has been designed to enable iterative and interactive exploration of sample networks.},

@article{Neelsen.2015,
 abstract = {The remodelling of replication forks into four-way junctions following replication perturbation, known as fork reversal, was hypothesized to promote DNA damage tolerance and repair during replication. Albeit conceptually attractive, for a long time fork reversal in vivo was found only in prokaryotes and specific yeast mutants, calling its evolutionary conservation and physiological relevance into question. Based on the recent visualization of replication forks in metazoans, fork reversal has emerged as a global, reversible and regulated process, with intriguing implications for replication completion, chromosome integrity and the DNA damage response. The study of the putative in vivo roles of recently identified eukaryotic factors in fork remodelling promises to shed new light on mechanisms of genome maintenance and to provide novel attractive targets for cancer therapy.},

@article{Mutreja.2018,
 abstract = {Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are toxic DNA lesions interfering with DNA metabolism that are induced by widely used anticancer drugs. They have long been considered absolute roadblocks for replication forks, implicating complex DNA repair processes at stalled or converging replication forks. Recent evidence challenged this view, proposing that single forks traverse ICLs by yet elusive mechanisms. Combining ICL immunolabeling and single-molecule approaches in human cells, we now show that ICL induction leads to global replication fork slowing, involving forks not directly challenged by ICLs. Active fork slowing is linked to rapid recruitment of RAD51 to replicating chromatin and to RAD51/ZRANB3-mediated fork reversal. This global modulation of fork speed and architecture requires ATR activation, promotes single-fork ICL traverse-here, directly visualized by electron microscopy-and prevents chromosomal breakage by untimely ICL processing. We propose that global fork slowing by remodeling provides more time for template repair and promotes bypass of residual lesions, limiting fork-associated processing.},

@article{Mijic.2017,
 abstract = {Besides its role in homologous recombination, the tumor suppressor BRCA2 protects stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation. Defective fork stability contributes to chemotherapeutic sensitivity of BRCA2-defective tumors by yet-elusive mechanisms. Using DNA fiber spreading and direct visualization of replication intermediates, we report that reversed replication forks are entry points for fork degradation in BRCA2-defective cells. Besides MRE11 and PTIP, we show that RAD52 promotes stalled fork degradation and chromosomal breakage in BRCA2-defective cells. Inactivation of these factors restores reversed fork frequency and chromosome integrity in BRCA2-defective cells. Conversely, impairing fork reversal prevents fork degradation, but increases chromosomal breakage, uncoupling fork protection, and chromosome stability. We propose that BRCA2 is dispensable for RAD51-mediated fork reversal, but assembles stable RAD51 nucleofilaments on regressed arms, to protect them from degradation. Our data uncover the physiopathological relevance of fork reversal and illuminate a complex interplay of homologous recombination factors in fork remodeling and stability.BRCA2 is involved in both homologous recombination (HR) and the protection of stalled replication forks from degradation. Here the authors reveal how HR factors cooperate in fork remodeling, showing that BRCA2 supports RAD51 loading on the regressed arms of reversed replication forks to protect them from degradation.},

 abstract = {The discovery of DNA repair defects in human syndromes, initially in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) but later in many others, led to striking observations on the association of molecular defects and patients' clinical phenotypes. For example, patients with syndromes resulting from defective nucleotide excision repair (NER) or translesion synthesis (TLS) present high levels of skin cancer in areas exposed to sunlight. However, some defects in NER also lead to more severe symptoms, such as developmental and neurological impairment and signs of premature aging. Skin cancer in XP patients is clearly associated with increased mutagenesis and genomic instability, reflecting the defective repair of DNA lesions. By analogy, more severe symptoms observed in NER-defective patients have also been associated with defective repair, likely involving cell death after transcription blockage of damaged templates. Endogenously induced DNA lesions, particularly through oxidative stress, have been identified as responsible for these severe pathologies. However, this association is not that clear and alternative explanations have been proposed. Despite high levels of exposure to intense sunlight, patients from tropical countries receive little attention or care, which likely also reflects the lack of understanding of how DNA damage causes cancer and premature aging.},

@article{Massey.2018,
 abstract = {Diseases such as Huntington's disease and certain spinocerebellar ataxias are caused by the expansion of genomic cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeats beyond a specific threshold. These diseases are all characterised by neurological symptoms and central neurodegeneration, but our understanding of how expanded repeats drive neuronal loss is incomplete. Recent human genetic evidence implicates DNA repair pathways, especially mismatch repair, in modifying the onset and progression of CAG repeat diseases. Repair pathways might operate directly on repeat sequences by licensing or inhibiting repeat expansion in neurons. Alternatively, or in addition, because many of the genes containing pathogenic CAG repeats encode proteins that themselves have roles in the DNA damage response, it is possible that repeat expansions impair specific DNA repair pathways. DNA damage could then accrue in neurons, leading to further expansion at repeat loci, thus setting up a vicious cycle of pathology. In this review, we consider DNA damage and repair pathways in postmitotic neurons in the context of disease-causing CAG repeats. Investigating and understanding these pathways, which are clearly relevant in promoting and ameliorating disease in humans, is a research priority, as they are known to modify disease and therefore constitute prevalidated drug targets.},

 abstract = {Accurate transmission of the genetic information requires complete duplication of the chromosomal DNA each cell division cycle. However, the idea that replication forks would form at origins of DNA replication and proceed without impairment to copy the chromosomes has proven naive. It is now clear that replication forks stall frequently as a result of encounters between the replication machinery and template damage, slow-moving or paused transcription complexes, unrelieved positive superhelical tension, covalent protein-DNA complexes, and as a result of cellular stress responses. These stalled forks are a major source of genome instability. The cell has developed many strategies for ensuring that these obstructions to DNA replication do not result in loss of genetic information, including DNA damage tolerance mechanisms such as lesion skipping, whereby the replisome jumps the lesion and continues downstream; template switching both behind template damage and at the stalled fork; and the error-prone pathway of translesion synthesis.},

@article{Li.2008,
 abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) comprises a series of interrelated pathways that function in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). In addition, recombination provides critical support for DNA replication in the recovery of stalled or broken replication forks, contributing to tolerance of DNA damage. A central core of proteins, most critically the RecA homolog Rad51, catalyzes the key reactions that typify HR: homology search and DNA strand invasion. The diverse functions of recombination are reflected in the need for context-specific factors that perform supplemental functions in conjunction with the core proteins. The inability to properly repair complex DNA damage and resolve DNA replication stress leads to genomic instability and contributes to cancer etiology. Mutations in the BRCA2 recombination gene cause predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer as well as Fanconi anemia, a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a defect in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. The cellular functions of recombination are also germane to DNA-based treatment modalities of cancer, which target replicating cells by the direct or indirect induction of DNA lesions that are substrates for recombination pathways. This review focuses on mechanistic aspects of HR relating to DSB and ICL repair as well as replication fork support.},

 abstract = {DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are bulky lesions that~interfere with DNA metabolism and therefore threaten genomic integrity. Recent studies implicate the metalloprotease SPRTN in S phase removal of DPCs, but how SPRTN is targeted to DPCs during DNA replication is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN and proteasome activities are coupled to DNA replication by distinct mechanisms that promote replication across immovable protein barriers.},

This mode of translocation allows helicases to bypass blocks on the strand that is excluded from the central channel. Unlike other replicative helicases, eukaryotic CMG helicase partially encircles duplex DNA at a forked junction and is stopped by a block on the non-tracking (lagging) strand. This report demonstrates that Mcm10, an essential replication protein unique to eukaryotes, binds CMG and greatly stimulates its helicase activity in vitro. Most significantly, Mcm10 enables CMG and the replisome to bypass blocks on the non-tracking DNA strand. We demonstrate that bypass occurs without displacement of the blocks and therefore Mcm10 must isomerize the CMG-DNA complex to achieve the bypass function.},

@article{Perkins.2009,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Gene co-expression networks are often constructed by computing some measure of similarity between expression levels of gene transcripts and subsequently applying a high-pass filter to remove all but the most likely biologically-significant relationships. The selection of this expression threshold necessarily has a significant effect on any conclusions derived from the resulting network. Many approaches have been taken to choose an appropriate threshold, among them computing levels of statistical significance, accepting only the top one percent of relationships, and selecting an arbitrary expression cutoff.

RESULTS

We apply spectral graph theory methods to develop a systematic method for threshold selection. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed for a transformation of the adjacency matrix of the network constructed at various threshold values. From these, we use a basic spectral clustering method to examine the set of gene-gene relationships and select a threshold dependent upon the community structure of the data. This approach is applied to two well-studied microarray data sets from Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

CONCLUSION

This method presents a systematic, data-based alternative to using more artificial cutoff values and results in a more conservative approach to threshold selection than some other popular techniques such as retaining only statistically-significant relationships or setting a cutoff to include a percentage of the highest correlations.},

 abstract = {TDP1 and TDP2 were discovered and named based on the fact they process 3'- and 5'-DNA ends by excising irreversible protein tyrosyl-DNA complexes involving topoisomerases I and II, respectively. Yet, both enzymes have an extended spectrum of activities. TDP1 not only excises trapped topoisomerases I (Top1 in the nucleus and Top1mt in mitochondria), but also repairs oxidative damage-induced 3'-phosphoglycolates and alkylation damage-induced DNA breaks, and excises chain terminating anticancer and antiviral nucleosides in the nucleus and mitochondria. The repair function of TDP2 is devoted to the excision of topoisomerase II- and potentially topoisomerases III-DNA adducts. TDP2 is also essential for the life cycle of picornaviruses (important human and bovine pathogens) as it unlinks VPg proteins from the 5'-end of the viral RNA genome. Moreover, TDP2 has been involved in signal transduction (under the former names of TTRAP or EAPII). The DNA repair partners of TDP1 include PARP1, XRCC1, ligase III and PNKP from the base excision repair (BER) pathway. By contrast, TDP2 repair functions are coordinated with Ku and ligase IV in the non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ). This article summarizes and compares the biochemistry, functions, and post-translational regulation of TDP1 and TDP2, as well as the relevance of TDP1 and TDP2 as determinants of response to anticancer agents. We discuss the rationale for developing TDP inhibitors for combinations with topoisomerase inhibitors (topotecan, irinotecan, doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone) and DNA damaging agents (temozolomide, bleomycin, cytarabine, and ionizing radiation), and as novel antiviral agents.},

@article{Wu.2019,
 abstract = {Cells often use multiple pathways to repair the same DNA lesion, and the choice of pathway has substantial implications for the fidelity of genome maintenance. DNA interstrand crosslinks covalently link the two strands of DNA, and thereby block replication and transcription; the cytotoxicity of these crosslinks is exploited for chemotherapy. In Xenopus egg extracts, the collision of replication forks with interstrand crosslinks initiates two distinct repair pathways. NEIL3 glycosylase can cleave the crosslink1; however, if this fails, Fanconi anaemia proteins incise the phosphodiester backbone that surrounds the interstrand crosslink, generating a double-strand-break intermediate that is repaired by homologous recombination2. It is not known how the simpler NEIL3 pathway is prioritized over the Fanconi anaemia pathway, which can cause genomic rearrangements. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP is required for both pathways. When two replisomes converge at an interstrand crosslink, TRAIP ubiquitylates the replicative DNA helicase CMG (the complex of CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS). Short ubiquitin chains recruit NEIL3 through direct binding, whereas longer chains are required for the unloading of CMG by the p97 ATPase, which enables the Fanconi anaemia pathway. Thus, TRAIP controls the choice between the two known pathways of replication-coupled interstrand-crosslink repair. These results, together with our other recent findings3,4 establish TRAIP as a master regulator of CMG unloading and the response of the replisome to obstacles.},

A recent model that proposed sets of adaptors for p97 selected according to the type of p97 activity seemed to afford a simple solution. For example, one known adaptor, the Ufd1-Npl4 complex, has been implicated in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis whereas another, p47, is an essential co-factor for membrane fusion. However, further investigation has revealed that the situation is more complicated. Both Ufd1-Npl4 and p47 adaptors bind ubiquitin, and so their activities may be more closely related than first thought. A role for ubiquitin in p97-dependent membrane fusion is a particularly surprising development with no obvious explanation. However, some clues may be found from looking at the role of ubiquitin and the AAA ATPase Vps4 during sorting on the endocytic pathway.},

These lesions may be removed and repaired, rather than just tolerated, to allow continuity of DNA replication on an undamaged DNA template. However, it is unclear how this is achieved at a molecular level. Here we identify a new replication-associated factor, ZRANB3 (zinc finger, RAN-binding domain containing 3), and propose its role in the repair of replication-blocking lesions. ZRANB3 has a unique structure-specific endonuclease activity, which is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. It cleaves branched DNA structures with unusual polarity, generating an accessible 3'-OH group in the template of the leading strand. Furthermore, ZRANB3 localizes to DNA replication sites and interacts with the components of the replication machinery. It is recruited to damaged replication forks via multiple mechanisms, which involve interactions with PCNA, K63-polyubiquitin chains, and branched DNA structures. Collectively, our data support a role for ZRANB3 in the replication stress response and suggest new insights into how DNA repair is coordinated with DNA replication to maintain genome stability.},

DPCs frequently occur in cells, either as a consequence of metabolism or exogenous agents, but the mechanism of DPC repair is not completely understood. Here, we characterize SPRTN as a specialized DNA-dependent and DNA replication-coupled metalloprotease for DPC repair. SPRTN cleaves various DNA binding substrates during S-phase progression and thus protects proliferative cells from DPC toxicity. Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome (RJALS) patient cells with monogenic and biallelic mutations in SPRTN are hypersensitive to DPC-inducing agents due to a defect in DNA replication fork progression and the inability to eliminate DPCs. We propose that SPRTN protease represents a specialized DNA replication-coupled DPC repair pathway essential for DNA replication progression and genome stability. Defective SPRTN-dependent clearance of DPCs is the molecular mechanism underlying RJALS, and DPCs are contributing to accelerated aging and cancer.},

We uncover a role for Ku in regulating end-resection of unbroken forks and in fine-tuning HR-mediated replication restart.},

We show here that when DPC proteolysis is blocked, the replicative DNA helicase CMG (CDC45, MCM2-7, GINS), which travels on the leading strand template, bypasses an intact leading strand DPC. Single-molecule imaging reveals that GINS does not dissociate from CMG during bypass and that CMG slows dramatically after bypass, likely due to uncoupling from the stalled leading strand. The DNA helicase RTEL1 facilitates bypass, apparently by generating single-stranded DNA beyond the DPC. The absence of RTEL1 impairs DPC proteolysis, suggesting that CMG must bypass the DPC to~enable proteolysis. Our results suggest a mechanism that prevents inadvertent CMG destruction by DPC proteases, and they reveal CMG's remarkable capacity to overcome obstacles on its translocation strand.},

In vertebrates, ICL repair is triggered when replication forks collide with the lesion, leading to FANCI-FANCD2-dependent unhooking and formation of a double-strand break (DSB) intermediate. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we describe here a replication-coupled ICL repair pathway that does not require incisions or FANCI-FANCD2. Instead, the ICL is unhooked when one of the two N-glycosyl bonds forming the cross-link is cleaved by the DNA glycosylase NEIL3. Cleavage by NEIL3 is the primary unhooking mechanism for psoralen and abasic site ICLs. When N-glycosyl bond cleavage is prevented, unhooking occurs via FANCI-FANCD2-dependent incisions. In summary, we identify an incision-independent unhooking mechanism that avoids DSB formation and represents the preferred pathway of ICL repair in a vertebrate cell-free system.},

@article{Sanchez.1992,
 abstract = {Injection of the circular plasmid FV1 (derived from type I bovine papilloma virus) into Xenopus eggs before the start of the first cell cycle dramatically increases the efficiency of plasmid replication once eggs are chemically activated. We call this the preloading effect and report kinetic and quantitative characterization of this phenomenon here. The timing and the amount of FV1 synthesis were measured by both BrdUTP density labelling and an optimized method of selective enzymatic digestion of replicated and unreplicated molecules using the three methyladenosine-sensitive isoschizomers, DpnI, MboI and Sau3a. DpnI in 100 mM NaCl proved particularly useful for distinguishing and quantitating unreplicated, once-replicated, and repeatedly replicated molecules accumulated over several cell cycles. Our results reveal that both the amount of DNA replicated and the timing of synthesis during the first S-phase correlate with the length of the preloading period. Longer preloading leads to larger amounts of DNA being replicated sooner. In fact, up to 30-50{\%} of 1 ng injected plasmid can replicate in a semiconservative cell cycle-dependent manner during the first S-phase. But such high levels of synthesis during the first cell cycle appear to limit the egg's ability to rereplicate this material in subsequent cell cycles. The preloading effect does not depend on synthesis of either viral or egg proteins, but does appear to correlate with the extent of plasmid assembly into chromatin before the start of the cell cycle. We postulate that each plasmid molecule must achieve a critical degree of chromatin assembly before it can proceed along the replication pathway. These observations illuminate some of the difficulties inherent in building a vector for gene insertion into Xenopus embryos, but also suggest an experimental strategy toward this aim.},

@article{Rickman.2020,
 abstract = {DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are a form of DNA damage that requires the interplay of a number of repair proteins including those of the Fanconi anemia (FA) and the homologous recombination (HR) pathways. Pathogenic variants in the essential gene BRCA2/FANCD1, when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 function in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 recombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and RAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has been shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant nuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. Here, based on the analysis of BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants (c.8488-1G{\textgreater}A and c.8524C{\textgreater}T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical FA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of DNA at ICLs. Cells carrying BRCA2 DBD mutations are sensitive to ICL-inducing agents but resistant to HU treatment consistent with relatively high HR repair in these cells. BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN nuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the resection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate that unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 translocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not an integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of fork protection at different DNA lesions.},

The ability of PrimPol to function as a DNA primase stems from a simple but remarkable feature-almost complete lack of contacts to the DNA primer strand. This, in turn, allows two dNTPs to bind initiation and elongation sites on the enzyme for the formation of the first dinucleotide. PrimPol shows the ability to synthesize DNA opposite ultraviolet (UV) lesions; however, unexpectedly, the active-site cleft of the enzyme is constrained, which precludes the bypass of UV-induced DNA lesions by conventional translesion synthesis.

 abstract = {DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are toxic DNA lesions whose repair occurs in the S phase of metazoans via an unknown mechanism. Here, we describe a cell-free system based on Xenopus egg extracts that supports ICL repair. During DNA replication of a plasmid containing a site-specific ICL, two replication forks converge on the crosslink. Subsequent lesion bypass involves advance of a nascent leading strand to within one nucleotide of the ICL, followed by incisions, translesion DNA synthesis, and extension of the nascent strand beyond the lesion. Immunodepletion experiments suggest that extension requires DNA polymerase zeta. Ultimately, a significant portion of the input DNA is fully repaired, but not if DNA replication is blocked. Our experiments establish a mechanism for ICL repair that reveals how this process is coupled to DNA replication.},

 abstract = {DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), highly toxic lesions that covalently link the Watson and Crick strands of the double helix, are repaired by a complex, replication-coupled pathway in higher eukaryotes. The earliest DNA processing event in ICL repair is the incision of parental DNA on either side of the ICL ({\textquotedbl}unhooking{\textquotedbl}), which allows lesion bypass. Incisions depend critically on the Fanconi anemia pathway, whose activation involves ubiquitylation of the FANCD2 protein. Using Xenopus egg extracts, which support replication-coupled ICL repair, we show that the 3' flap endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 cooperates with SLX4/FANCP to carry out the unhooking incisions. Efficient recruitment of XPF-ERCC1 and SLX4 to the ICL depends on FANCD2 and its ubiquitylation. These data help define the molecular mechanism by which the Fanconi anemia pathway promotes a key event in replication-coupled ICL repair.},

@article{KlagesMundt.2017,
 abstract = {DNA is constantly exposed to a wide array of genotoxic agents, generating a variety of forms of DNA damage. DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs)-the covalent linkage of proteins with a DNA strand-are one of the most deleterious and understudied forms of DNA damage, posing as steric blockades to transcription and replication. If not properly repaired, these lesions can lead to mutations, genomic instability, and cell death. DPCs can be induced endogenously or through environmental carcinogens and chemotherapeutic agents. Endogenously, DPCs are commonly derived through reactions with aldehydes, as well as through trapping of various enzymatic intermediates onto the DNA. Proteolytic cleavage of the protein moiety of a DPC is a general strategy for removing the lesion. This can be accomplished through a DPC-specific protease and and/or proteasome-mediated degradation. Nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination are each involved in repairing DPCs, with their respective roles likely dependent on the nature and size of the adduct. The Fanconi anemia pathway may also have a role in processing DPC repair intermediates. In this review, we discuss how these lesions are formed, strategies and mechanisms for their removal, and diseases associated with defective DPC repair.},

Processes such as DNA damage tolerance and replication fork reversal protect stalled forks from these events. A central mediator of these DNA damage responses in humans is the Rad5-related DNA translocase, HLTF. Here, we present biochemical and structural evidence that the HIRAN domain, an ancient and conserved domain found in HLTF and other DNA processing proteins, is a modified oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) fold that binds to 3' ssDNA ends. We demonstrate that the HIRAN domain promotes HLTF-dependent fork reversal in vitro through its interaction with 3' ssDNA ends found at forks. Finally, we show that HLTF restrains replication fork progression in cells in a HIRAN-dependent manner. These findings establish a mechanism of HLTF-mediated fork reversal and provide insight into the requirement for distinct fork remodeling activities in the cell.},

 abstract = {Chromosomal DNA replication requires the recruitment of the six-subunit minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) complex to chromatin through the action of Cdc6 and Cdt1. Although considerable work has described the functions of Cdc6 and Cdt1 in yeast and biochemical systems, evidence that their mammalian counterparts are subject to distinct regulation suggests the need to further explore the molecular relationships involving Cdc6 and Cdt1. Here we demonstrate that Cdc6 and Cdt1 are mutually dependent on one another for loading Mcm complexes onto chromatin in mammalian cells. The association of Cdt1 with Mcm2 is regulated by cell growth. Mcm2 prepared from quiescent cells associates very weakly with Cdt1, whereas Mcm2 from serum-stimulated cells associates with Cdt1 much more efficiently. Cdc6, which normally accumulates as cells progress from quiescence into G(1), is capable of inducing the binding of Mcm2 to Cdt1 when ectopically expressed in quiescent cells. We further show that Cdc6 physically associates with Cdt1 via its N-terminal noncatalytic domain, a region we had previously shown to be essential for Cdc6 function. Cdt1 activity is inhibited by the geminin protein, and we provide evidence that the mechanism of this inhibition involves blocking the binding of Cdt1 to both Mcm2 and Cdc6. These results identify novel molecular functions for both Cdc6 and geminin in controlling the association of Cdt1 with other components of the replication apparatus and indicate that the association of Cdt1 with the Mcm complex is controlled as cells exit and reenter the cell cycle.},

@article{Carter.2004,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Gene expression data have become an instrumental resource in describing the molecular state associated with various cellular phenotypes and responses to environmental perturbations. The utility of expression profiling has been demonstrated in partitioning clinical states, predicting the class of unknown samples and in assigning putative functional roles to previously uncharacterized genes based on profile similarity. However, gene expression profiling has had only limited success in identifying therapeutic targets. This is partly due to the fact that current methods based on fold-change focus only on single genes in isolation, and thus cannot convey causal information. In this paper, we present a technique for analysis of expression data in a graph-theoretic framework that relies on associations between genes. We describe the global organization of these networks and biological correlates of their structure. We go on to present a novel technique for the molecular characterization of disparate cellular states that adds a new dimension to the fold-based methods and conclude with an example application to a human medulloblastoma dataset.

RESULTS

We have shown that expression networks generated from large model-organism expression datasets are scale-free and that the average clustering coefficient of these networks is several orders of magnitude higher than would be expected for similarly sized scale-free networks, suggesting an inherent hierarchical modularity similar to that previously identified in other biological networks. Furthermore, we have shown that these properties are robust with respect to the parameters of network construction. We have demonstrated an enrichment of genes having lethal knockout phenotypes in the high-degree (i.e. hub) nodes in networks generated from aggregate condition datasets; using process-focused Saccharomyces cerivisiae datasets we have demonstrated additional high-degree enrichments of condition-specific genes encoding proteins known to be involved in or important for the processes interrogated by the microarrays. These results demonstrate the utility of network analysis applied to expression data in identifying genes that are regulated in a state-specific manner. We concluded by showing that a sample application to a human clinical dataset prominently identified a known therapeutic target.

Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free.

Genes, proteins and miRNAs can be connected based on in silico and/or experimental information and integrated into a ClueGO network of terms/pathways. Interrelations within each pathway can be investigated, and new potential associations may be revealed through gene/protein/miRNA enrichments. A pathway-like visualization can be created using the Cerebral plugin layout. Combining all these features is essential for data interpretation and the generation of new hypotheses. The CluePedia Cytoscape plugin is user-friendly and has an expressive and intuitive visualization.

Common fragile site (CFS) loci are particularly sensitive to replication stress and undergo pathological rearrangements in tumors. At these loci, replication stress frequently activates DNA repair synthesis in mitosis. This mitotic DNA synthesis, termed MiDAS, requires the MUS81-EME1 endonuclease and a non-catalytic subunit of the Pol-delta complex, POLD3. Here, we examine the contribution of HR factors in promoting MiDAS in human cells. We report that RAD51 and BRCA2 are dispensable for MiDAS but are required to counteract replication stress at CFS loci during S-phase. In contrast, MiDAS is RAD52 dependent, and RAD52 is required for the timely recruitment of MUS81 and POLD3 to CFSs in early mitosis. Our results provide further mechanistic insight into MiDAS and define a specific function for human RAD52.

 abstract = {SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like1) maintains genome integrity during DNA replication. Here we investigated its mechanism of action. We found that SMARCAL1 travels with elongating replication forks, and its absence leads to MUS81-dependent double-strand break formation. Binding to specific nucleic acid substrates activates SMARCAL1 activity in a reaction that requires its HARP2 (Hep-A-related protein 2) domain. Homology modeling indicates that the HARP domain is similar in structure to the DNA-binding domain of the PUR proteins. Limited proteolysis, small-angle X-ray scattering, and functional assays indicate that the core enzymatic unit consists of the HARP2 and ATPase domains that fold into a stable structure. Surprisingly, SMARCAL1 is capable of binding three-way and four-way Holliday junctions and model replication forks that lack a designed ssDNA region. Furthermore, SMARCAL1 remodels these DNA substrates by promoting branch migration and fork regression. SMARCAL1 mutations that cause Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia or that inactivate the HARP2 domain abrogate these activities. These results suggest that SMARCAL1 continuously surveys replication forks for damage. If damage is present, it remodels the fork to promote repair and restart. Failures in the process lead to activation of an alternative repair mechanism that depends on MUS81-catalyzed cleavage of the damaged fork.},

Here we use Xenopus egg extracts to test the hypothesis that efficient replication results from chromatin assembly prior to activation giving preloaded plasmids a head start toward the formation of a replicating pseudonucleus (Sanchez, J.A., Marek, D., and Wangh, L.J. (1992) J. Cell Sci. 103, 907-918). As in ovum, plasmid DNA preincubated in unactivated egg cytoplasmcytostatic factor extracts) replicate more efficiently after extract activation than does the same DNA added to the same extract after activation. Unlike in ovum, however, plasmids that replicate efficiently in vitro do not assemble into chromatin during preincubation and become topologically knotted instead. But even DNA knotting does not explain subsequent efficient replication. Also, plasmids preassembled into chromatin in vitro do not replicate efficiently in activated egg cytoplasm unless first preincubated in a CSF extract.

 abstract = {DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are extremely cytotoxic, but the mechanism of their repair remains incompletely understood. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we previously showed that repair of a cisplatin ICL is triggered when two replication forks converge on the lesion. After CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS (CMG) ubiquitylation and unloading by the p97 segregase, FANCI-FANCD2 promotes DNA incisions by XPF-ERCC1, leading to ICL unhooking. Here, we report that, during this cell-free ICL repair reaction, one of the two converged forks undergoes reversal. Fork reversal fails when CMG unloading is inhibited, but it does not require FANCI-FANCD2. After one fork has undergone reversal, the opposing fork that still abuts the ICL undergoes incisions. Our data show that replication fork reversal at an ICL requires replisome disassembly. We present a revised model of ICL repair that involves a reversed fork intermediate.},

Complete and accurate replication once and only once per cell division cycle is essential to maintain genome integrity and prevent disease. Impediments to replication fork progression including difficult to replicate DNA sequences, conflicts with transcription, and DNA damage further add to the genome maintenance challenge. These obstacles frequently cause fork stalling, but only rarely cause a failure to complete replication. Robust mechanisms ensure that stalled forks remain stable and capable of either resuming DNA synthesis or being rescued by converging forks. However, when failures do happen the fork collapses leading to genome rearrangements, cell death and disease. Despite intense interest, the mechanisms to repair damaged replication forks, stabilize them, and ensure successful replication remain only partly understood. Different models of fork collapse have been proposed with varying descriptions of what happens to the DNA and replisome. Here, I will define fork collapse and describe what is known about how the replication checkpoint prevents it to maintain genome stability.},

The exact mechanisms by which ATR regulates DNA synthesis in conditions of replication stress are largely unknown, but this activity is critical for the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, making ATR a potential therapeutic target. Here we use selective ATR inhibitors to demonstrate that acute inhibition of ATR kinase activity yields rapid cell lethality, disrupts the timing of replication initiation, slows replication elongation, and induces fork collapse. We define the mechanism of this fork collapse, which includes SLX4-dependent cleavage yielding double-strand breaks and CtIP-dependent resection generating excess single-stranded template and nascent DNA strands. Our data suggest that the DNA substrates of these nucleases are generated at least in part by the SMARCAL1 DNA translocase. Properly regulated SMARCAL1 promotes stalled fork repair and restart; however, unregulated SMARCAL1 contributes to fork collapse when ATR is inactivated in both mammalian and Xenopus systems. ATR phosphorylates SMARCAL1 on S652, thereby limiting its fork regression activities and preventing aberrant fork processing. Thus, phosphorylation of SMARCAL1 is one mechanism by which ATR prevents fork collapse, promotes the completion of DNA replication, and maintains genome integrity.},

Although the CDC45 MCM GINS (CMG) structure implies that interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are absolute blocks to replisomes, recent studies indicate that cells can restart DNA synthesis on the side of the ICL distal to the initial encounter. Here, we report that restart requires ATR and is promoted by FANCD2 and phosphorylated FANCM. Following introduction of genomic ICLs and dependent on ATR and FANCD2 but not on the Fanconi anemia core proteins or FAAP24, FANCM binds the replisome complex, with concomitant release of the GINS proteins. In situ analysis of replisomes proximal to ICLs confirms the ATR-dependent release of GINS proteins while CDC45 is retained on the remodeled replisome.

However, interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which preclude DNA unwinding, are considered absolute blocks to replication. Current models suggest that fork collisions, either from one or both sides of an ICL, initiate repair processes required for resumption of replication. To test these proposals, we developed a single-molecule technique for visualizing encounters of replication forks with ICLs as they occur in living cells. Surprisingly, the most frequent patterns were consistent with replication traverse of an ICL, without lesion repair. The traverse frequency was strongly reduced by inactivation of the translocase and DNA binding activities of the FANCM/MHF complex. The results indicate that translocase-based mechanisms enable DNA synthesis to continue past ICLs and that these lesions are not always absolute blocks to replication.},

 abstract = {THE MERGING OF NETWORK THEORY AND MICROARRAY DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES HAS SPAWNED A NEW FIELD: gene coexpression network analysis. While network methods are increasingly used in biology, the network vocabulary of computational biologists tends to be far more limited than that of, say, social network theorists. Here we review and propose several potentially useful network concepts. We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks. Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps. Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory. We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields. Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them. We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.e., adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions. High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively. We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership. We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene expression data. The unification of coexpression network methods with traditional data mining methods can inform the application and development of systems biologic methods.},

Mus81 is the catalytic component of a eukaryotic structure-specific endonuclease that preferentially cleaves branched DNA substrates reminiscent of replication and recombination intermediates. Here we explore the mechanisms by which Mus81 maintains chromosomal stability. We found that Mus81 is involved in the formation of double-strand DNA breaks in response to the inhibition of replication. Moreover, in the absence of chromosome processing by Mus81, recovery of stalled DNA replication forks is attenuated and chromosomal aberrations arise. We suggest that Mus81 suppresses chromosomal instability by converting potentially detrimental replication-associated DNA structures into intermediates that are more amenable to DNA repair.},

Here, we discovered an independent ATR activation pathway in vertebrates, mediated by the uncharacterized protein ETAA1 (Ewing's tumour-associated antigen 1). Human ETAA1 accumulates at DNA damage sites via dual RPA-binding motifs and promotes replication fork progression and integrity, ATR signalling and cell survival after genotoxic insults. Mechanistically, this requires a conserved domain in ETAA1 that potently and directly stimulates ATR kinase activity independently of TopBP1. Simultaneous loss of ETAA1 and TopBP1 gives rise to synthetic lethality characterized by massive genome instability and abrogation of ATR-dependent signalling. Our findings demonstrate that parallel TopBP1- and ETAA1-mediated pathways underlie ATR activation and that their combined action is essential for coping with replication stress.},

We used electron microscopy to visualize fork architecture under these conditions and analyzed the association of specific molecular features with checkpoint activation. Our data identify replication fork uncoupling and reversal as global responses to genotoxic treatments. Both events are frequent even after mild treatments that do not affect fork integrity, nor activate checkpoints. Fork reversal was found to be dependent on the central homologous recombination factor RAD51, which is consistently present at replication forks independently of their breakage, and to be antagonized by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase/RECQ1-regulated restart. Our work establishes remodeling of uncoupled forks as a pivotal RAD51-regulated response to genotoxic stress in human cells and as a promising target to potentiate cancer chemotherapy.},

 abstract = {An important role for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway in maintaining genomic stability is embodied in its conservation through evolution and the link between loss of MMR function and tumorigenesis. The latter is evident as inheritance of mutations within the major MMR genes give rise to the cancer predisposition condition, Lynch syndrome. Nonetheless, how MMR loss contributes to tumorigenesis is not completely understood. In addition to preventing the accumulation of mutations, MMR also directs cellular responses, such as cell cycle checkpoint or apoptosis activation, to different forms of DNA damage. Understanding this MMR-dependent DNA damage response may provide insight into the full tumor suppressing capabilities of the MMR pathway. Here, we delve into the proposed mechanisms for the MMR-dependent response to DNA damaging agents. We discuss how these pre-clinical findings extend to the clinical treatment of cancers, emphasizing MMR status as a crucial variable in selection of chemotherapeutic regimens. Also, we discuss how loss of the MMR-dependent damage response could promote tumorigenesis via the establishment of a survival advantage to endogenous levels of stress in MMR-deficient cells.},

@article{Gillis.2012,
 abstract = {Gene networks are commonly interpreted as encoding functional information in their connections. An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share function. Guilt by association provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the network. In effect, the apparent encoding of function within networks has been largely driven by outliers whose behaviour cannot even be generalized to individual genes, let alone to the network at large. While experimentalist-driven analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale computational analyses have typically assumed that high-performance cross-validation in a network is due to a generalizable encoding of function. Because we find that gene function is not systemically encoded in networks, but dependent on specific and critical interactions, we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks encode function and what information computational analyses use to extract functional meaning. We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as scale-free-like behaviour, do not map onto the functional connectivity within networks.},

@article{Franke.2006,
 abstract = {Most common genetic disorders have a complex inheritance and may result from variants in many genes, each contributing only weak effects to the disease. Pinpointing these disease genes within the myriad of susceptibility loci identified in linkage studies is difficult because these loci may contain hundreds of genes. However, in any disorder, most of the disease genes will be involved in only a few different molecular pathways. If we know something about the relationships between the genes, we can assess whether some genes (which may reside in different loci) functionally interact with each other, indicating a joint basis for the disease etiology. There are various repositories of information on pathway relationships. To consolidate this information, we developed a functional human gene network that integrates information on genes and the functional relationships between genes, based on data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, Reactome, the Human Protein Reference Database, the Gene Ontology database, predicted protein-protein interactions, human yeast two-hybrid interactions, and microarray co-expressions. We applied this network to interrelate positional candidate genes from different disease loci and then tested 96 heritable disorders for which the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database reported at least three disease genes. Artificial susceptibility loci, each containing 100 genes, were constructed around each disease gene, and we used the network to rank these genes on the basis of their functional interactions. By following up the top five genes per artificial locus, we were able to detect at least one known disease gene in 54{\%} of the loci studied, representing a 2.8-fold increase over random selection. This suggests that our method can significantly reduce the cost and effort of pinpointing true disease genes in analyses of disorders for which numerous loci have been reported but for which most of the genes are unknown.},

 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Choosing and Using Statistics remains an invaluable guide for students using a computer package to analyse data from research projects and practical class work. The text takes a pragmatic approach to statistics with a strong focus on what is actually needed. There are chapters giving useful advice on the basics of statistics and guidance on the presentation of data. The book is built around a key to selecting the correct statistical test and then gives clear guidance on how to carry out the test and interpret the output from four commonly used computer packages: SPSS, Minitab, Excel, and (new to this edition) the free program, R. Only the basics of formal statistics are described and the emphasis is on jargon-free English but any unfamiliar words can be looked up in the extensive glossary. This new 3rd edition of Choosing and Using Statistics is a must for all students who use a computer package to apply statistics in practical and project work. Features new to this edition: * Now features information on using the popular free program, R * Uses a simple key and flow chart to help you choose the right statistical test * Aimed at students using statistics for projects and in practical classes * Includes an extensive glossary and key to symbols to explain any statistical jargon * No previous knowledge of statistics is assumed{\textquotedbl}--},

@article{Dungrawala.2015,
 abstract = {The ATR replication checkpoint ensures that stalled forks remain stable when replisome movement is impeded. Using an improved iPOND protocol combined with SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterized human replisome dynamics in response to fork stalling. Our data provide a quantitative picture of the replisome and replication stress response proteomes in 32 experimental conditions. Importantly, rather than stabilize the replisome, the checkpoint prevents two distinct types of fork collapse. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of protein abundance on nascent DNA is sufficient to identify protein complexes and place newly identified replisome-associated proteins into functional pathways. As an example, we demonstrate that ZNF644 complexes with the G9a/GLP methyltransferase at replication forks and is needed to prevent replication-associated DNA damage. Our data reveal how the replication checkpoint preserves genome integrity, provide insights into the mechanism of action of ATR inhibitors, and will be a useful resource for replication, DNA repair, and chromatin investigators.},

@article{Dilley.2016,
 abstract = {Homology-directed DNA repair is essential for genome maintenance through templated DNA synthesis. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) necessitates homology-directed DNA repair to maintain telomeres in about 10-15{\%} of human cancers. How DNA damage induces assembly and execution of a DNA replication complex (break-induced replisome) at telomeres or elsewhere in the mammalian genome is poorly understood. Here we define break-induced telomere synthesis and demonstrate that it utilizes a specialized replisome, which underlies ALT telomere maintenance. DNA double-strand breaks enact nascent telomere synthesis by long-tract unidirectional replication. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) loading by replication factor C (RFC) acts as the initial sensor of telomere damage to establish predominance of DNA polymerase \textgreek{d} (Pol \textgreek{d}) through its POLD3 subunit. Break-induced telomere synthesis requires the RFC-PCNA-Pol \textgreek{d} axis, but is independent of other canonical replisome components, ATM and ATR, or the homologous recombination protein Rad51. Thus, the inception of telomere damage recognition by the break-induced replisome orchestrates homology-directed telomere maintenance.},

@article{Cupello.2016,
 abstract = {In response to a variety of DNA replication stress or DNA damaging agents, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are triggered for cells to coordinate DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and senescence. Cell-free Xenopus egg extracts, derived from the eggs of African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), have been widely used for studies concerning DDR pathways. In this review, we focus on how different experimental systems have been established using Xenopus egg extracts to investigate the DDR pathways that are activated in response to DNA replication stress, double-strand breaks (DSBs), inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs), and oxidative stress. We summarize how molecular details of DDR pathways are dissected by the mechanistic studies with Xenopus egg extracts. We also provide an update on the regulation of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases (Pol ĸ and REV1) in the DDR pathways. A better understanding of DDR pathways using Xenopus egg extracts has opened new avenues for future cancer therapeutics. Finally, we offer our perspectives of future directions for studies of DDR pathways with Xenopus egg extracts.},

@article{Graham.2017,
 abstract = {It has been assumed that DNA synthesis by the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases in the replisome must be coordinated to avoid the formation of significant gaps in the nascent strands. Using real-time single-molecule analysis, we establish that~leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases function independently within a single replisome. Although average rates of DNA synthesis on leading and lagging strands are similar, individual trajectories of both DNA polymerases display stochastically switchable rates of synthesis interspersed with distinct pauses. DNA unwinding by the replicative helicase may continue during such pauses, but a self-governing mechanism, where helicase speed is reduced by $\sim$80{\%}, permits recoupling of polymerase to helicase. These features imply a more dynamic, kinetically discontinuous replication process, wherein contacts within the replisome are continually broken and reformed. We conclude that the stochastic behavior of replisome components ensures complete DNA duplication without requiring coordination of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis. PAPERCLIP.},

@article{Zhang.2005,
 abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},
